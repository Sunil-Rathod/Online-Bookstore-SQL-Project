# Online Bookstore SQL Project

## Overview:
This SQL project analyzes an online bookstore using three datasets: Books, Customers, and Orders. The project includes database creation, table design, data import from CSV files, and execution of 20 SQL queries ranging from basic to advanced.

## ðŸ“Œ Datasets:

Books.xlsx: <a href="https://github.com/Sunil-Rathod/Online-Bookstore-SQL-Project/blob/main/Books.csv"> </a>

Contains book details including title, author, genre, price, and stock.

Orders.xlsx: <a href= "https://github.com/Sunil-Rathod/Online-Bookstore-SQL-Project/blob/main/Orders.csv"> </a>

Contains records of book orders, including quantity and total amount.

SELECT AVG(price) AS Average_Price
FROM Books
WHERE Genre = 'Fantasy';


â€¢ List customers who have placed at least 2 orders:

SELECT o.customer_id, c.name, COUNT(o.Order_id) AS ORDER_COUNT
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY o.customer_id, c.name
HAVING COUNT(Order_id) >= 2;


â€¢ Find the most frequently ordered book:

SELECT o.Book_id, b.title, COUNT(o.order_id) AS ORDER_COUNT
FROM orders o
JOIN books b ON o.book_id = b.book_id
GROUP BY o.book_id, b.title
ORDER BY ORDER_COUNT DESC
LIMIT 1;


â€¢ Show the top 3 most expensive books of 'Fantasy' Genre:

SELECT * FROM books
WHERE genre = 'Fantasy'
ORDER BY price DESC
LIMIT 3;


â€¢ Retrieve the total quantity of books sold by each author:

FROM orders o
JOIN books b ON o.book_id = b.book_id
GROUP BY b.Author;


â€¢ List the cities where customers who spent over $30 are located:

SELECT DISTINCT c.city, total_amount
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE o.total_amount > 30;


â€¢ Find the customer who spent the most on orders:

SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, SUM(o.total_amount) AS Total_Spent
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name
ORDER BY Total_spent DESC
LIMIT 1;


â€¢ Calculate the stock remaining after fulfilling all orders:

SELECT b.book_id, b.title, b.stock, COALESCE(SUM(o.quantity),0) AS Order_quantity,
b.stock - COALESCE(SUM(o.quantity),0) AS Remaining_Quantity
FROM books b
LEFT JOIN orders o ON b.book_id = o.book_id
GROUP BY b.book_id
ORDER BY b.book_id;
